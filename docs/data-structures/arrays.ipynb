    "An array is a collection of items. The items inside the array can be integers, strings, dictionaries, tuples and so on. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. The array is implemented to dynamically change the size and allocate memory based on the number of elements present in the array. Let's take a look at how to create an array in Python."
